6006,Hi John. We're going to share this photo with Green Line supervisors.
6007,Thank you! We're going to look into this.
6008,Hi Damian. We have just sent this to our maintenance team to address. Thank you!
6009,"Sorry about this, Adam. We want to fix the signs on that train - do you remember a train number or what time you got on?"
6010,Sorry about this Erika. At which stop and what direction did this occur at?
6011,Hmm. Any chance you got the number of the car you heard that on?
6012,Sorry about this Hannah. Would you mind sending us a direct message to tell us what happened? Thank you!
6013,"Thanks for the tweet, Christine. We've contacted bus dispatchers to get in touch with the operator."
6014,"On the Red Line, we shuttled weekend service so we could replace 440 ft of 30-year-old track at Downtown Crossing. At the same time, we refurbished fare gates, elevators, & platforms at stations including Park St & South Station. Visit: http://mbta.com/RLwork #BuildingABetterT"
6015,Thank you for the details and sorry about this occurrence. We'll share your message with supervisors so they can look into this.
6016,Thank you - we will share it with bus dispatchers to have the operator attempt a reset.
6017,Thanks for the photo. It's a bit blurry on our end - is it not showing the destination?
6018,Hi Eric. Work is ongoing at Park Street and continues on weeknights and the 2 upcoming weekend diversions.
6019,"We see a 101 at Sullivan now. It should be leaving soon, if it hasn't already."
6020,Regularly scheduled service has resumed.
6021,"Thank you Sam. We will forward this to our maintenance team. To submit formal feedback, please use this link https://www.mbta.com/customer-support"
6022,Northbound Red Line trains delayed 10 minutes because of a train with a door problem at Downtown Crossing.
6023,Hi Sam. Sorry about this. At what station did you observe this?
6024,"Thank you for the feedback, Nicole. We will share it with our countdown team."
6025,Good Afternoon Greg. There is no evening work this week on the Orange Line. It will resume next Sunday night at 8:30 PM.
6026,"Thanks to the additional access provided by these accelerated diversions, we were able to expand the scope of work to include replacing 8,480 feet of track across the Green Line - further increasing safety, service, and reliability for our riders. #BuildingABetterT"
6027,"Over the weekend, we finished upgrading the last 2 intersections on the Green Line B Branch, bringing the project to 100% completion - 5 months ahead of the original schedule. In all, we renovated 30 intersections across the Green and Mattapan Lines. #BuildingABetterT"
6028,"Yes, ideally, serving Park St going north would shorten the distance riders would have to walk. But again, with street patterns & heavy traffic congestion in the area, stopping at Park St north would add a significant amount of time to the shuttle route & would slow service."
6029,"Hello. We're sorry to see this seat back has come off. If you see any mechanical issues with a train, please provide a car number (numbered at front/rear), when possible, so we can have it fixed asap."
6030,Thanks for the additional information. We will pass this on to Bus Supervisors so the operator can be recognized. Have a good day!
6031,Hello. Thanks for reaching out to us. Due to traffic patterns around Downtown Crossing (like one-way streets and pedestrian-only zones) means shuttle buses are unable to directly serve the main entrances to the station. We apologize for any inconvenience.
6032,Hi Jarred. Thanks for sharing this with us. Our Realtime Apps team is aware of this messaging and is working to fine-tune the countdown clocks predictions during diversions. Apologies for any confusion.
6033,Hi Rhonda. We really appreciate this kind message. We'll be sure this operator is commended. Have a good day!
6034,Hi there. Thanks for tagging us. We'll make sure maintenance is aware and cleans this up safely and quickly.

6036,Hi Dennis. Thanks for the photo. We'll forward it to station maintenance to have taken care of.
6037,Hi Jan. Thank you for sharing this with us. We understand this to be a temporary measure for safety while permanent repairs are planned. We've reached out to our Maintenance Department for a status update.
6038,Good Morning and thanks for reaching out. Can you tell us more about your interaction with the operator?
6039,Thanks for the additonal information. Bus Supervisors have been notified and are having the bus checked.
6040,We were referring to what was happening in this situation at South Station. If you feel unsafe due to a smoke condition or other hazard in a station the fire alarm boxes and call boxes can certainly be used.
6041,"South Station and Red Line Officials were actively investigating a report of smoke. If there was an immediate danger, the fire alarms would have sounded and customers would have been notified if an evacuation was necessary."
6042,Good Morning. Red Line Supervisors are aware and are checking into this.

12790,"Until then, the folks at our Operations Control Center are in constant contact with operators, dispatchers, and inspectors out in the field, providing location and arrival info for system alerts and more."
12791,"We know what a pain this is, and while we can‰Ûªt get data from the signals at JFK/UMass, we‰Ûªre working on using the data we get from other stations to bring back predictions along the Red Line."
12792,"That‰Ûªs why, if you‰Ûªre waiting at Park Street for a northbound train to Davis, you might not see arrival predictions in minutes, even though it‰Ûªs outside of the signal data gap."
12793,"Normally, when a northbound train passes through Broadway, the signal data helps predict its arrival at the next few stations based on typical travel times. Since we aren‰Ûªt getting that data from Broadway Station, our system can‰Ûªt predict arrival times at the next few stops."
12794,"This is effective and safe, but not as efficient as automatic data updates. It also means that we‰Ûªre not receiving the signal data that informs arrival predictions for stations on the rest of the line"
12795,"The damage to the signals at JFK/UMass created a data gap between Broadway and Fields Corner. While the signals are being repaired, we have crews out in the field communicating with the Operations Control Center about train locations."
12796,"It also informs our real-time data, which we use for in-station countdown clocks, our website, and 3rd-party apps like Google Maps and Transit. This is what those signals usually looks like."
12797,"That hardware takes in data from the signal infrastructure along the tracks, and sends it out to places like our Operations Control Center, where dispatchers monitor trains traveling through the system."
12798,"Earlier this week, we mentioned that the derailment damaged the signal bungalows at JFK/UMass that house the hardware for our signal system."
12799,"Repairs to the tracks and 3rd rail at JFK/UMass are now complete, but trains are still moving slowly through the station, and you might be wondering why we‰Ûªre not able to give specific arrival times on our website and in-station countdown clocks."
